## Getting Started

- For this project, I am seeking to answer the following research question: **Are Data Science skills predictive of salary?**

- In order to be able to find an answer to the above question, I will seek to analyse a series of case scenarios. Each case, represent a job posting in the United States. There are 390 observations in the given data set.

- **The Data** was collected by [Paysa](https://www.paysa.com/) as part of the Integrated job posting website during the Spring of 2017. The data was submitted by employers daily.

- This is an **observational type study**.

- The R code can be found on this location.

- The published proposal can be found in RPubs [here](http://rpubs.com/dvillalobos/data606-project-proposal).

- The final project results can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/dvillalobos/DATA606-FinalProject).

- The respective code can be found in the diverse folders named: **"Final-Project-Proposal"** and **"Final-Project"** respectively on this location.
