## Getting Started

This repository contains solutions to projects and assignments that I have submitted during my masters in Data Science at [City University of New York School of Professional Studies](https://sps.cuny.edu/academics/graduate/master-science-data-science-ms).

### Description

**DATA 606** - Statistics and Probability for Data Analytics

**Credits:** 3.

**Prerequisite:** None.

This course covers basic techniques in probability and statistics that are important in the field of data analytics. Discrete probability models, sampling from infinite and finite populations, statistical distributions, basic Bayesian statistics, and non-parametric statistical techniques for categorical data are covered in this course. Each of these statistical concepts will be applied in a variety of real-world scenarios through the use of case studies and customized data sets.

### Textbooks

**Required**

- Diez, D.M., Barr, C.D., & Çetinkaya-Rundel, M. (2015). OpenIntro Statistics (3rd Ed).

  This is an open source textbook and can be downloaded in PDF format [here](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php), from the OpenIntro website, or a printed copy can be ordered from Amazon.

- Navarro, D. (2015, version 0.5). Learning Statistics with R

  This is free textbook that supplements a lot of the material covered in Diez and Barr. We will use the chapter on Bayesian analysis.

## Credits

<br />

- **Credit the author:** If you're planing on learning Data Science, you can feel free to take my code as reference, but make sure you do your part. I've invested considerable amount of time searching, thinking and creating and crediting all of these solutions, and I would request for you to add the reference in case some of my solutions inspire you to create further solutions.
