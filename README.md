## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy for **all** the projects ready to run on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See individual deployment notes for each project in order to run on your system.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dvillalobos/MSDS.git
```

### Prerequisites

In this section, I will briefly mention the software needed and how to install them.

<br />

- This repository was created during my studies at [City University of New York School of Professional Studies](https://sps.cuny.edu/academics/graduate/master-science-data-science-ms). In which I was enrolled in a Master's in Data Science.

<br />

- The work that is presented in this repository, represent solutions to diverse assignments and projects during my masters for all classes in general.

<br />


- Many of these assignments were created using diverse software; **some of my preferred tools are:**

<br />

- My preferred Operating System for the whole masters was **Lubuntu**.

<br />

- My approach was to create an **"Ultimate Operating System"** that require little memory with an ability to expand and handle most of the requirements for the assignments and projects related to Data Science.

<br />

- In order to facilitate replication of the installation process; I wrote a **script** that performs a Data Science Server automatic installation from scratch. If you are interested, you can find my simple guide [here](https://dvillalobos.github.io/2018/transform-my-home-server-into-data-science-server/).

<br />

- A great advantage of having this setup, is that I was able to have my personal home server at home, to which I connected remotely using **SSH** (Secure Shell) in order to do my assignments; thus, saving me some money and resources from any given cloud offering such as [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com), [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) or even [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) just to mention a few.

<br />

- A common disadvantage for this approach, is that I had **"limited"** resources, and could not scale up in case needed; but for my diverse assignments I did not have a need to scale up.

<br />

**My current specs for my Home Server are:**

- 64 GB Memory.
- 8 Cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.60GHz.
- 1 TB Solid State Drive.
- 4 TB Hard Disk Drive.
- GPU: FirePro V5700 by ATI (limited capability).

Then, I connected remotely from a **Chromebook** with 4GB of memory.


<br />

<br />

- My number one choice for Data Science projects is R. In my particular case, I did perform an installation of R server; thus, allowing me to connect using any popular web browser (firefox or chrome). In my personal experience, I find R more suitable for Data Science projects due to the strong statistical capabilities and extensive set of libraries available, alongside the Open Source community which is great!

<br />

- Some of the tools that I have employed in R are: Plot.ly, Shiny and tidy just to mention a few. The list is long and some projects include Random Forest, XGBost and Neural Networks for predictive analysis for example...

<br />


![](https://github.com/dvillalobos/MSDS/blob/master/images/python.png)

<br />

- My second choice for Data Science special projects is Python 3. In my particular case, I did install Spyder and Atom with Hydrogen for local programing use, the beaty of Python, is that I was able to use a text editor in my Chromebook connected through SSH and was a ble to run the code from terminal and exploring the results in a web browser. With Python 3, I've been able to build beautiful dashboards and websites that facilitate the communication with diverse tools such as JavaScript, Html and Database management with NoSQL for example.

<br /> 

- With Python 3, I was able to create custom containers built in Docker using diverse Linux systems, which then, I uploaded to the cloud and ran them in Amazon AWS EC2 Cloud. Some examples run Flask and JavaScript for website interaction with with geospatial data manipulation employing Dash and Mongo DB alongside plot.ly.

<br />

- Sometimes, it's easier just to write a small presentation using a notebook; with Jupyter Notebooks I was able to employ diverse kernels from one simple location.

- The beauty of writing your code in a Jupyter notebook, is that you can upload them to GitHub, and then create and share outstanding results employing the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) online tool. I higly recommend this approach too.

<br />



![](https://github.com/dvillalobos/MSDS/blob/master/images/sql.png)

<br />

- Other tools that I've setup in my Home Server are: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (noSql database framework), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) (sql database framework) and [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) (graph database); thus, in order to practice and experiment with calculations in systems were the data is present or non-present.

I've invested considerable amount of time searching, thinking and creating and crediting all of these solutions, and I would request for you to add the reference in case some of my solutions inspire you to create further solutions.
